# Sample crowdsale starter project

This is a sample project for getting started with a custom crowdsale contract with [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/). It is an introductory example to learn how to use OpenZeppelin. Note that this project has not been audited and hence **is not intended for production use**.

The `contracts` folder has a sample crowdsale and token, with explicit points on where to override its behaviour.

## Setup

1- Install [nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

2- Clone the project by running `git clone git@github.com:OpenZeppelin/sample-crowdsale-starter.git`

3- Change directory into the project via `cd sample-crowdsale-starter`

4- Install dependencies by running `npm install`

## Tests

Tests are run via `npm test`. There are some pending tests waiting for you to implement the missing features, and make sure to write a test for every new feature you add!

## Docs

Check out the API docs for OpenZeppelin [here](https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/open-zeppelin.html). 

The Crowdsale contract [docs](https://openzeppelin.org/api/docs/crowdsale_Crowdsale.html) docs and [source](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.6.0/contracts/crowdsale/Crowdsale.sol) may be particularly helpful in this project!
